# The Categorization and Quantification of Pulsars Using ATNF Pulsar Catalogue Data

## Introduction
This project aims to explore how observational data can be used to categorize and quantify the diverse groups of pulsars in the universe. By utilizing data from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the study implements clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups of pulsars, analyzes their properties, and validates the results against known pulsar characteristics.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to set up your environment with the required libraries.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/athirakmenon/FINAL-PROJECT.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FINAL-PROJECT
    ```
3. Install the necessary Python libraries using :
    ```bash
    pip install 
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: The project begins by downloading and preprocessing data from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue.(FINAL-PROJECT/Neutronstars.csv)

2. **Running the Notebook**: Open the `FINAL.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells in order. This will guide you through the steps of importing the data, performing clustering, and visualizing the results.

3. **Clustering**: The project implements various clustering algorithms like KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Agglomerative Clustering to identify different pulsar groups.

4. **Validation**: After clustering, the results are validated using known pulsar characteristics and references from literature.

## Features
- **Data Downloading and Preprocessing**:  Download and prepare the data from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms to categorize pulsars.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization of clustering results and analysis of pulsar properties.
- **Validation**: Validation of the clustering results against known data and literature.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue.The dataset's documentation explicitly allows usage for research purposes. Evidence of this permission can be found in the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue's official documentation, which states that the data is freely available for academic and research use under the NU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.
